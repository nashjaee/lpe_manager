# lpe_manager
This is a utility for managing custom AOVs with LPEs in the Arnold rendering engine inside of Maya. It has been tested and known to work in Maya 2019, but should work in other versions as well as long as PyMel and Arnold are available.

With just a few clicks, the utility generates commonly-used AOVs for selected light groups.
